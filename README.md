**A linguistically-grounded alternative to subword tokenization for language modeling.**

> Arabic morphology has an algebraic structure: **root × pattern = concept**.
> The root ك-ت-ب (k-t-b, write) combined with the pattern فَاعِل (agent) produces كاتب (writer).
> CST generalizes this principle — encoding semantic field and morphological role directly into every token — and applies it to any language.

## Results

Trained on 100K English sentences with GPT-2 architecture at **identical parameter counts**, evaluated using **bits-per-character (BPC)** — a metric that is directly comparable across tokenizers:

| Tokenizer         | Vocab | Params | Tokens/sent | BPC ↓    |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------ | ----------- | -------- |
| **CST**           | 8K    | 6.8M   | **22.1**    | **1.13** |
| SentencePiece BPE | 8K    | 6.8M   | 31.7        | 1.75     |
| **CST**           | 32K   | 13.0M  | **22.1**    | **1.23** |
| SentencePiece BPE | 32K   | 13.0M  | 26.6        | 1.65     |

**35.5% BPC reduction** at 8K vocabulary. **25.2%** at 32K.
CST also trains **1.56× faster** due to 30% shorter token sequences.

### Arabic (100K Wikipedia sentences)

Trained on 100K Arabic Wikipedia sentences with the same GPT-2 architecture, **identical parameter counts**, and BPC evaluation:

| Tokenizer         | Vocab | Params | Tokens/sent | BPC ↓    |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------ | ----------- | -------- |
| **Arabic CST**    | 8K    | 6.8M   | **20.3**    | **1.15** |
| SentencePiece BPE | 8K    | 6.8M   | 30.1        | 2.12     |
| **Arabic CST**    | 32K   | 13.0M  | **20.3**    | **1.29** |
| SentencePiece BPE | 32K   | 13.0M  | 24.0        | 2.01     |

**46.0% BPC reduction** at 8K vocabulary. **35.8%** at 32K.
Arabic's triconsonantal root system is a natural fit for CST — the advantage over BPE is even larger than in English (46% vs 35.5%).

### Cross-lingual comparison

| Metric                | CST-8K   | SPM-8K   | CST-32K  | SPM-32K  |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| English BPC           | 1.13     | 1.75     | 1.23     | 1.65     |
| Arabic BPC            | 1.15     | 2.12     | 1.29     | 2.01     |
| **Cross-lingual gap** | **0.02** | **0.37** | **0.06** | **0.36** |

BPE creates a 21% performance penalty for Arabic (1.75 → 2.12). CST reduces the cross-lingual gap to 1.8% (1.13 → 1.15) — within measurement noise. A significant portion of Arabic's historically observed difficulty in language modeling is attributable to tokenization, not the language itself.

## How It Works

Instead of statistical subword fragments, CST maps every word to a typed semantic token:

| Type   | Format           | Example           | Meaning                                |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `CMP`  | `CMP:field:role` | `CMP:write:agent` | "writer" — write field, agent role     |
| `ROOT` | `ROOT:field`     | `ROOT:move`       | semantic field only, no derivation     |
| `REL`  | `REL:relation`   | `REL:causes`      | grammatical or logical relation        |
| `STR`  | `STR:marker`     | `STR:negation`    | sentence-level structural marker       |
| `LIT`  | `LIT:surface`    | `LIT:the`         | function words, proper nouns, fallback |

**Example:** `"The researchers discovered that rewriting the algorithm significantly improved computational efficiency."`

```
STR:past  LIT:the  CMP:science:agent  CMP:know:past  REL:that
CMP:write:repeat  LIT:the  ROOT:think  CMP:quality:manner
CMP:fix:past  CMP:think:quality  CMP:work:state
```

12 tokens vs. 17 fragments from BPE-8K — and every CST token carries an explicit semantic label.

The tokenizer runs in **7 stages**: normalize → detect structure → split words → identify named entities → lemmatize → morphological decomposition → emit token. The vocabulary contains ~846 semantic tokens derived from ~45 universal semantic fields and ~2,400 lemma-to-field mappings. These fields are language-agnostic: "write" in English, "écrire" in French, and "كتب" in Arabic all resolve to the same token space.

## Paper

The full study is available in this repository:

- **English:** [`docs/paper/cst-paper.md`](docs/paper/cst-paper.md)
- **Arabic:** [`docs/paper/cst-paper-ar.md`](docs/paper/cst-paper-ar.md) — published simultaneously in Arabic; to our knowledge the first NLP systems paper to do so.

**Title:** _Contextual Semantic Tokenization: A Linguistically-Grounded Alternative to Subword Segmentation for Language Modeling_
**Author:** Emad Jumaah

The paper covers the conceptual origin in Arabic triconsonantal morphology, the full 7-stage tokenizer design, a controlled comparison against SentencePiece BPE at matched vocabulary sizes and parameter counts, experimental results, mechanistic analysis, cross-lingual properties, limitations, and future directions.

npm install
npm test                # run the test suite
npx tsx src/demo.ts     # tokenize example sentences
```

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+, TypeScript.

## Background

This project originated from the [Arabic Algebra Engine](https://emadjumaah.github.io/aae/), which organized 820+ Arabic roots into semantic domains based on the triconsonantal root system. The key observation: Arabic morphology is a formal algebra — root × pattern = concept — refined over fourteen centuries of linguistic scholarship. CST is the generalization of that algebra into a tokenization framework for neural language models.

## Regenerating Data

Training data (tokenized .jsonl files) is gitignored to keep the repo small. To regenerate:

```bash
# English: CST + SentencePiece BPE at 8K and 32K vocab
python training/cap_cst_vocab.py          # CST-8K and CST-32K
python training/train_bpe.py              # SPM-8K and SPM-32K

# Arabic: download 100K Wikipedia sentences + CST + SPM at 8K/32K
python training/arabic_experiment_v2.py --sentences 100000

# Coverage analysis (on cached 1K Arabic sentences)
python training/analyze_missed.py
```

**Requirements:** `pip install -r training/requirements.txt` + `camel_tools` with morphology DB (`camel_data -i morphology-db-msa-r13`).
