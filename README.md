# Contextual Semantic Tokenization (CST)

**A linguistically-grounded alternative to subword tokenization for language modeling.**

> Arabic morphology has an algebraic structure: **root × pattern = concept**.  
> The root ك-ت-ب (write) combined with the pattern فَاعِل (agent) produces كاتب (writer).  
> CST generalizes this principle — encoding semantic field and morphological role directly into every token — and applies it to any language.

## Results

Trained on 100K English sentences with GPT-2 architecture, **identical parameter counts**, using **bits-per-character (BPC)** as the cross-tokenizer metric:

| Tokenizer | Vocab | Params | Tokens/sent | BPC ↓ |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **CST** | 8K | 6.8M | **22.1** | **1.13** |
| SentencePiece BPE | 8K | 6.8M | 31.7 | 1.75 |
| **CST** | 32K | 13.0M | **22.1** | **1.23** |
| SentencePiece BPE | 32K | 13.0M | 26.6 | 1.65 |

**35.5% BPC reduction** at 8K vocabulary. **25.2%** at 32K.  
CST also trains **1.56× faster** due to 30% shorter token sequences.

## How It Works

Instead of statistical subword fragments, CST produces typed semantic tokens:

| Type | Format | Example | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|---------|
| `CMP` | `CMP:field:role` | `CMP:write:agent` | "writer" — write field, agent role |
| `ROOT` | `ROOT:field` | `ROOT:move` | bare semantic field, no derivation |
| `REL` | `REL:relation` | `REL:causes` | grammatical / logical relation |
| `STR` | `STR:marker` | `STR:negation` | sentence-level structure |
| `LIT` | `LIT:surface` | `LIT:the` | function words, proper nouns, fallback |

**Example:** `"The researchers discovered that rewriting the algorithm significantly improved computational efficiency."`

```
STR:past  LIT:the  CMP:science:agent  CMP:know:past  REL:that
CMP:write:repeat  LIT:the  ROOT:think  CMP:quality:manner
CMP:fix:past  CMP:think:quality  CMP:work:state
```
12 tokens. BPE-8K produces 17 fragments that carry no semantic structure.

The pipeline has **7 stages**: normalize → structure detect → word split → NER → lemmatize → morphological decompose → emit. The vocabulary contains ~846 semantic tokens (CMP, ROOT, REL, STR) derived from ~45 universal semantic fields and ~2,400 lemma-to-field mappings. These are language-agnostic: "write" in English, "écrire" in French, and "كتب" in Arabic all map to the same field.

**Author:** Emad Jumaah

The paper covers: conceptual origin in Arabic morphology → 7-stage pipeline description → controlled fair comparison (matched vocab sizes, matched parameter counts) → results → discussion of mechanisms → cross-lingual properties → limitations and future work.

## Background

This project began with the [Arabic Algebra Engine](https://emadjumaah.github.io/aae/), which organized 820+ Arabic roots into semantic domains based on the triconsonantal root system. The key observation: Arabic morphology is a formal algebra that has operated for 1,400 years. CST is the generalization of that algebra into a tokenization framework for neural language models.
