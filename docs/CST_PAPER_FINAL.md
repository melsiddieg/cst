# Contextual Semantic Tokenization: A Linguistically-Grounded Alternative to Subword Segmentation for Language Modeling

**Emad Jumaah**

---

## Abstract

We introduce Contextual Semantic Tokenization (CST), a tokenization method that segments text into linguistically-motivated semantic units rather than statistically-derived subword fragments. The approach originates from an observation about Arabic triconsonantal morphology: Arabic roots and patterns constitute a natural algebraic system in which root × pattern = concept, providing semantic structure directly in the vocabulary. We generalize this insight to a universal framework applicable to any language. CST maps words to a closed set of semantic fields through lemmatization, morphological decomposition, and field resolution, producing structured tokens such as `CMP:write:agent` for "writer" or `REL:causes` for "because." In controlled experiments training GPT-2 language models from scratch on 100K English sentences, we compare CST against SentencePiece BPE at matched vocabulary sizes (8K and 32K) and identical model architectures, ensuring equal parameter counts. Using bits-per-character (BPC) as the evaluation metric, CST achieves 1.13 BPC versus 1.75 BPC for SentencePiece at 8K vocabulary (35.5% reduction) and 1.23 versus 1.65 at 32K vocabulary (25.2% reduction). CST also produces shorter token sequences (22.1 tokens/sentence versus 31.7 for BPE-8K), yielding proportionally faster training. These results suggest that encoding linguistic structure directly into the tokenization layer provides a stronger inductive bias for language modeling than frequency-based subword segmentation — a principle first made visible by Arabic morphology and here generalized to English and beyond.

## 1. Introduction

Tokenization is the first transformation applied to text before it reaches a neural language model, yet it remains largely disconnected from linguistic theory. The dominant approach, Byte Pair Encoding (BPE; Sennrich et al., 2016) and its variants (WordPiece, Unigram), constructs a vocabulary by iteratively merging frequent character sequences. The resulting tokens are statistical artifacts: they reflect surface-level co-occurrence patterns in the training corpus rather than semantic or grammatical units. A word like "unhappiness" might be split into "un," "happ," "iness" — fragments that carry no consistent linguistic meaning across contexts.

The motivation for this work comes from an unexpected source: Arabic morphology.

Arabic is a Semitic language built on a triconsonantal root system. Every Arabic word is derived from a three-consonant root (الجذر, _al-jidhr_) through the application of a vowel pattern (الوزن, _al-wazn_). The root ك-ت-ب (k-t-b) encodes the semantic domain of writing. Applying ten canonical patterns produces ten distinct words:

| Pattern (وزن) | Operator    | Result   | Meaning                |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| فَاعِل        | agent       | كاتب     | writer                 |
| مَفْعُول      | patient     | مكتوب    | letter / written thing |
| مَفْعَلَة     | place       | مكتبة    | library                |
| فِعَال        | instance    | كتاب     | a book                 |
| فُعُول        | plural      | كُتُب    | books                  |
| اِسْتِفْعَال  | seek        | استكتاب  | requesting to write    |
| تَفَاعُل      | mutual      | تكاتُب   | exchanging letters     |
| مُفَاعَلَة    | process     | مُكاتَبة | correspondence         |
| فَعَّال       | intensifier | كتَّاب   | professional scribe    |
| مُفْعِل       | causer      | مُكتِب   | one who dictates       |

This is not merely linguistic description — it is an algebra. Root × Pattern = Concept. The semantic field (writing) and the morphological role (agent, place, patient) compose deterministically into a specific meaning. Crucially, this structure is encoded directly in the word's surface form: a morphological analyzer can recover both root and pattern from any Arabic word without external context.

This algebraic property of Arabic morphology suggests a hypothesis: **what if tokens in a language model's vocabulary carried the same structured information?** Instead of arbitrary subword fragments, what if each token explicitly encoded its semantic field and its morphological role?

We generalize this insight beyond Arabic into a universal framework. All human languages encode meaning compositionally in word structure — through suffixes and prefixes in English, through agglutination in Turkish, through noun classes in Swahili, through the same Semitic root system in Hebrew and Arabic. These are different surface realizations of a shared principle: **morphology encodes semantic relationships**. CST extracts those relationships and makes them explicit in the token vocabulary.

The Arabic root-pattern system makes this principle maximally visible because the composition is surface-transparent: the root and pattern can be read directly from the word's consonant skeleton and vowel template. English requires a lookup step (lemmatization + affix detection) to recover the same information. But the information is there in both languages — Arabic simply makes it harder to miss.

This paper makes the following contributions:

1. We trace the conceptual origin of CST to Arabic triconsonantal morphology, showing how root × pattern composition generalizes to a universal tokenization principle.
2. We describe the CST pipeline, a seven-stage tokenizer that produces typed, linguistically-annotated tokens for English.
3. We present a controlled comparison against SentencePiece BPE at matched vocabulary sizes and parameter counts, isolating tokenization strategy as the sole variable.
4. We report a 35.5% BPC reduction at 8K vocabulary and 25.2% at 32K vocabulary, demonstrating that linguistic structure in tokenization improves language modeling efficiency.
5. We analyze CST's cross-lingual properties, showing that its semantic token space is language-agnostic and that Arabic and other morphologically rich languages are natural beneficiaries.

## 2. Related Work

**Subword tokenization.** BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016) and its variants — WordPiece (Schuster & Nakajima, 2012), Unigram (Kudo, 2018), and SentencePiece (Kudo & Richardson, 2018) — remain the standard tokenization methods for neural language models. These methods optimize compression of the training corpus without reference to linguistic structure. Recent work has noted limitations: Bostrom & Durrett (2020) show that BPE segmentation often misaligns with morphological boundaries, and Rust et al. (2021) demonstrate that tokenizer quality degrades for under-represented languages in multilingual models.

**Morphological tokenization.** Attempts to incorporate morphology into tokenization include Morfessor (Creutz & Lagus, 2007), which segments words into morphs using minimum description length, and the work of Ataman & Federico (2018), who apply supervised morphological segmentation to neural machine translation. These approaches improve handling of morphologically rich languages but do not assign semantic content to tokens. Arabic-specific work includes CAMeLBERT (Inoue et al., 2021) and AraBERT (Antoun et al., 2020), which apply morphological preprocessing before BERT-style training but retain subword vocabularies at the model input layer.

**Semitic morphology as computation.** The algebraic structure of Semitic root-pattern morphology has been studied formally since McCarthy (1981), who introduced autosegmental phonology to model the nonconcatenative nature of Arabic and Hebrew word formation. Beesley & Karttunen (2003) developed finite-state transducer models for Semitic morphology, and Kiraz (2001) extended this to multitiered representations. These works treat morphology as a parsing problem — recovering roots and patterns from surface forms. CST inverts this: it uses the recovered structure as a generative vocabulary for neural models.

**Semantic representations in NLP.** Semantic field theory (Trier, 1931) and frame semantics (Fillmore, 1982) propose that word meanings organize into structured fields. FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and WordNet (Miller, 1995) provide computational inventories of semantic relations. However, these resources have not been applied at the tokenization layer — they are typically used downstream for tasks such as semantic role labeling.

**CST's position.** CST bridges the gap between morphological tokenization and semantic representation. It draws on Arabic morphology's algebraic structure as its conceptual foundation, extends the root-pattern decomposition to English through lemmatization and affix detection, and encodes the result directly in the token vocabulary that the language model trains on. Unlike morphological segmenters, CST maps tokens to semantic fields. Unlike semantic databases, CST operates at the tokenization layer. The key novelty is that the semantic structure is not a downstream annotation — it is the vocabulary itself.

## 3. From Arabic Algebra to Universal Tokenization

Before describing the CST pipeline, we make explicit the conceptual path from Arabic morphology to the general framework. This origin is not incidental — the design decisions in CST reflect the structure of Arabic morphology directly.

### 3.1 Arabic as the Blueprint

In Arabic, every content word is the product of two orthogonal components:

- **Root (الجذر):** A set of three (occasionally four) consonants encoding a semantic domain. The root ك-ت-ب covers the entire domain of writing and recording; the root ع-ل-م covers the domain of knowledge and learning; the root ج-م-ع covers gathering and assembly.

- **Pattern (الوزن):** A morphological template that specifies the word's grammatical role. The pattern فَاعِل (fā'il) produces the active agent of any root; مَفْعَلَة (maf'ala) produces the place associated with any root; مَفْعُول (maf'ūl) produces the passive patient of any root.

The composition root × pattern is deterministic and productive: given any root and any pattern, the resulting word's meaning is predictable. This is the algebra. كتب × فاعل = كاتب (writer); علم × مفعلة = مدرسة (school); جمع × استفعال = اجتماع (assembly/meeting).

CST's token type `CMP:field:role` is a direct encoding of this algebra. `CMP:write:agent` is the computational representation of كتب × فاعل. `CMP:know:place` is the computational representation of علم × مفعلة. The Arabic morphological system, studied and refined over fourteen centuries of linguistic scholarship, provides the conceptual foundation. CST makes it computable and language-independent.

### 3.2 Generalization to English

English does not have an Arabic-style root system, but it has morphological structure that encodes the same relationships less transparently:

| Arabic (explicit)                | English (recoverable)                                | CST token            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| كاتب (root:كتب + pattern:فاعل)   | writer (lemma:write + suffix:-er)                    | `CMP:write:agent`    |
| مكتبة (root:كتب + pattern:مفعلة) | library (semantic field:write + role:place)          | `CMP:write:place`    |
| مكتوب (root:كتب + pattern:مفعول) | document (semantic field:write + role:instance)      | `CMP:write:instance` |
| معلم (root:علم + pattern:مفعل)   | teacher (lemma:teach + suffix:-er + semantic causer) | `CMP:know:causer`    |

In Arabic, the extraction is morphological: root and pattern are read from the surface form. In English, the extraction requires lemmatization (write ← writer), affix detection (-er → agent), and semantic field lookup (write → field:write). The output is the same structured token. The Arabic route is more direct; the English route requires more processing. Both arrive at the same vocabulary.

### 3.3 Universal Semantic Fields

The semantic fields in CST — write, know, move, create, send, think, gather — are not English categories. They are universal semantic primitives that appear in all human languages because they describe fundamental human activities. McCarthy (1981) and subsequent work in linguistic typology have documented that semantic domains such as motion, cognition, creation, and communication are universal across unrelated language families.

This universality is the key to CST's cross-lingual potential. When Arabic الباحث (researcher) and English "researcher" both map to `CMP:science:agent`, a model training on both languages in the same token space learns a unified representation of the concept. The LIT tokens — function words, proper nouns, unresolved surface forms — carry language-specific information. The semantic tokens carry universal information. A multilingual model built on CST shares its semantic core entirely across languages; only the LIT layer varies.

## 4. Method

### 4.1 Overview

CST is a seven-stage pipeline that transforms raw text into a sequence of typed tokens. Each token belongs to one of six types:

| Type    | Format           | Example           | Description                                                |
| ------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| CMP     | `CMP:field:role` | `CMP:write:agent` | Composed: semantic field + morphological role              |
| ROOT    | `ROOT:field`     | `ROOT:move`       | Semantic field, no morphological derivation                |
| REL     | `REL:relation`   | `REL:causes`      | Grammatical or logical relation                            |
| STR     | `STR:structure`  | `STR:negation`    | Sentence-level structural marker                           |
| LIT     | `LIT:surface`    | `LIT:the`         | Literal token (function words, entities, unresolved words) |
| SPECIAL | `[PAD]`, `[UNK]` | `[UNK]`           | Padding and unknown tokens                                 |

The CMP token directly encodes the Arabic algebra: field = root semantic domain, role = pattern operator. ROOT encodes a semantic field without a recoverable morphological role. REL and STR encode sentence-level structure. LIT is the fallback for words that do not participate in the semantic algebra.

### 4.2 Pipeline Stages

**Stage 1: Normalization.** Input text is lowercased, Unicode smart quotes are replaced with ASCII equivalents, and whitespace is normalized. This ensures consistent downstream processing without losing semantic content.

**Stage 2: Structure detection.** A set of regular expressions scans the full sentence for structural patterns before word-level processing begins. Six structure types are detected:

- `STR:question` — terminal question mark
- `STR:negation` — negation markers (_not_, _never_, _cannot_, etc.)
- `STR:condition` — conditional markers (_if_, _unless_, _whenever_, etc.)
- `STR:future` — future tense markers (_will_, _shall_, _going to_)
- `STR:past` — past tense markers (_was_, _were_, _had_, _did_)
- `STR:emphasis` — terminal exclamation mark

Structure tokens are prepended to the token sequence, providing the model with a sentence-level frame before processing individual words. This mirrors the function of Arabic grammatical particles (هل for questions, لا for negation, سـ for future) which operate at the sentence level.

**Stage 3: Word splitting.** The normalized text is split on whitespace and punctuation boundaries. Contraction fragments (_'s_, _n't_, _'re_, _'ll_, _'ve_, _'d_, _'m_) and bare punctuation are filtered, as their semantic content is captured by structure detection or is negligible.

**Stage 4: Named entity recognition.** The NLP library compromise.js identifies named entities (people, places, organizations) in the original text. Recognized entities bypass morphological decomposition and field resolution, emitting directly as `LIT:surface` tokens to preserve proper nouns.

**Stage 5: Lemmatization.** Each word is lemmatized using compromise.js, which reduces verbs to infinitive form and nouns to singular. Results are cached in a persistent map to avoid redundant NLP calls; in a 100K-sentence run, approximately 78K unique word forms are encountered and cached.

**Stage 6: Morphological decomposition.** The surface form and lemma are compared to detect affixation:

- _Prefix detection_ (9 prefixes): Prefixes such as _un-_, _re-_, _dis-_, _pre-_, _mis-_, _over-_, _co-_, _out-_, _non-_ are matched at word boundaries, producing roles like `negate`, `repeat`, `before`. A minimum stem length of 3 characters prevents false positives.
- _Suffix detection_ (25 suffixes): When the surface form differs from the lemma at the end, the difference is matched against known suffixes. Suffixes are matched greedily (longest first) and produce roles such as `agent` (_-er_, _-or_, _-ist_), `instance` (_-tion_, _-ment_, _-ing_), `state` (_-ness_, _-ity_), `possible` (_-able_, _-ible_), `past` (_-ed_), `plural` (_-s_, _-es_), among others.

The mapping from affix to role mirrors the Arabic pattern system: where Arabic uses فاعل to mark the agent of any verb, English uses _-er_. The roles themselves — agent, patient, place, instance, causer — are identical across the two systems, because they reflect universal semantic relationships, not language-specific conventions.

**Stage 7: Token emission.** Each word is resolved to a token through a priority cascade:

1. If the word is a recognized named entity → `LIT:surface`
2. If the word is a digit sequence → `ROOT:size`
3. If the word appears in the relation map (~245 entries covering prepositions, conjunctions, modals, quantifiers, adverbs) → `REL:relation`
4. If the word is a function word (~95 entries: articles, pronouns, auxiliaries) → `LIT:surface`
5. The morphological root is looked up in a semantic field dictionary (~2,400 lemma-to-field mappings covering ~45 universal fields). A silent-e recovery heuristic (e.g., _writ_ → _write_) and nested suffix stripping expand coverage. If a field is found:
   - With a morphological role → `CMP:field:role` (e.g., _writer_ → `CMP:write:agent`)
   - Without a role → `ROOT:field` (e.g., _write_ → `ROOT:write`)
6. Fallback → `LIT:surface`

### 4.3 Semantic Field Inventory

The semantic field dictionary maps lemmas to one of approximately 45 universal fields. Representative examples:

| Lemma cluster                           | Field    |
| --------------------------------------- | -------- |
| consider, think, reason, judge, analyze | `think`  |
| go, travel, arrive, depart, return      | `move`   |
| make, build, create, produce, design    | `create` |
| know, learn, understand, study, teach   | `know`   |
| send, transmit, dispatch, deliver       | `send`   |
| write, record, document, publish        | `write`  |
| see, observe, watch, notice, perceive   | `see`    |

These fields are designed to be universal: the same fields apply across languages, since semantic primitives such as _move_, _think_, _create_, and _know_ appear in all human languages. This is not an assumption — it is the finding of cross-linguistic typology (Fillmore, 1982; Miller, 1995). The Arabic roots used in the original Arabic Algebra Engine (كتب for write, علم for know, رسل for send, جمع for gather) map directly to these fields. The field names are language-neutral labels for semantic domains that Arabic identified structurally.

### 4.4 Vocabulary Capping

In its unconstrained form, CST produces approximately 846 semantic tokens (CMP, ROOT, REL, STR, SPECIAL) and a variable number of LIT tokens for words not covered by the semantic field dictionary. For controlled comparison against a fixed-vocabulary baseline, we cap the CST vocabulary to a target size _V_ by:

1. Retaining all semantic tokens (~846)
2. Reserving slots for PAD and UNK
3. Filling the remaining _V - 848_ slots with the most frequent LIT tokens from the training corpus
4. Mapping all remaining LIT tokens to UNK

At 8K vocabulary, this produces a 5.6% UNK rate (rare words appearing fewer than 10 times). At 32K vocabulary, the UNK rate drops to 1.6%.

## 5. Experimental Setup

### 5.1 Dataset

We use 99,963 English sentences from the `agentlans/high-quality-english-sentences` dataset (Hugging Face), sourced from Wikipedia and covering diverse domains including science, history, geography, technology, and biography. The dataset provides broad lexical coverage without domain bias.

### 5.2 Tokenizer Configurations

We compare four tokenizer configurations in two matched pairs:

| Configuration | Tokenizer         | Vocab size | Description                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| CST-8K        | CST (capped)      | 8,000      | 846 semantic + 7,152 frequent LIT + PAD + UNK |
| SPM-8K        | SentencePiece BPE | 8,000      | Standard BPE trained on same corpus           |
| CST-32K       | CST (capped)      | 32,000     | 846 semantic + 31,152 LIT + PAD + UNK         |
| SPM-32K       | SentencePiece BPE | 32,000     | Standard BPE trained on same corpus           |

SentencePiece models are trained on the same 99,963 sentences using default BPE settings. This ensures both tokenizers see identical training data.

### 5.3 Model Architecture

All models use the GPT-2 architecture (Radford et al., 2019) as implemented in Hugging Face Transformers:

| Hyperparameter      | Value                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Embedding dimension | 256                       |
| Layers              | 6                         |
| Attention heads     | 4                         |
| Max sequence length | 128                       |
| Learning rate       | 3 × 10⁻⁴                  |
| Batch size          | 32                        |
| Optimizer           | AdamW (weight decay 0.01) |
| Scheduler           | Cosine annealing          |
| Epochs              | 3                         |
| Validation split    | 10%                       |

Within each vocabulary-matched pair, both models have **identical parameter counts**: 6.8M at 8K vocabulary (2.0M embedding + 4.7M transformer) and 13.0M at 32K vocabulary (8.2M embedding + 4.7M transformer). The only difference between paired models is the tokenization strategy.

### 5.4 Evaluation Metric

We use **bits-per-character (BPC)** as the primary evaluation metric:

$$\text{BPC} = \frac{\sum_i \text{NLL}_i}{C \cdot \ln 2}$$

where $\text{NLL}_i$ is the per-token negative log-likelihood summed over all validation tokens, and $C$ is the total number of characters in the original validation text.

BPC normalizes for differences in token sequence length and vocabulary size. Unlike perplexity, which operates in token space and is incomparable across tokenizers with different vocabularies, BPC measures how many bits the model requires to encode each character of the original text. Lower is better.

We also report per-token perplexity and average tokens per sentence for completeness, but emphasize that these metrics are not directly comparable across tokenizers.

## 6. Results

### 6.1 Main Results

| Metric              | CST-8K   | SPM-8K    | CST-32K  | SPM-32K   |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | -------- | --------- |
| Vocabulary          | 8,000    | 8,000     | 32,000   | 32,000    |
| Parameters          | 6.8M     | 6.8M      | 13.0M    | 13.0M     |
| Avg tokens/sentence | 22.1     | 31.7      | 22.1     | 26.6      |
| Val perplexity      | 113.0    | 163.9     | 172.8    | 302.5     |
| **Val BPC**         | **1.13** | **1.75**  | **1.23** | **1.65**  |
| **BPC reduction**   |          | **35.5%** |          | **25.2%** |

At 8K vocabulary, CST achieves a BPC of 1.13 compared to 1.75 for SentencePiece — a 35.5% reduction. At 32K vocabulary, CST achieves 1.23 versus 1.65 — a 25.2% reduction. Both comparisons use identical architectures with identical parameter counts.

### 6.2 Token Sequence Length

CST produces consistently shorter sequences: 22.1 tokens per sentence regardless of vocabulary cap, compared to 31.7 (SPM-8K) and 26.6 (SPM-32K). The stability of CST's sequence length across vocabulary sizes reflects the fact that semantic tokens are not affected by vocabulary capping — only rare LIT tokens are mapped to UNK, which does not change the token count.

The 30% shorter sequences have a direct computational benefit: CST-8K completes each training epoch in 102 seconds versus 159 seconds for SPM-8K on an NVIDIA T4 GPU, a 1.56× throughput improvement due to reduced sequence length in the self-attention computation.

### 6.3 Vocabulary Composition Effect

An unexpected finding is that CST-8K (1.13 BPC, 6.8M params) outperforms CST-32K (1.23 BPC, 13.0M params) despite having fewer parameters and a smaller vocabulary. We attribute this to vocabulary focus: at 8K, the vocabulary contains only high-frequency words alongside semantic tokens, reducing the sparsity of the embedding space. The 5.6% UNK rate at 8K effectively regularizes the model, forcing it to rely on semantic structure rather than memorizing rare surface forms.

This contrasts with SentencePiece, where the 32K vocabulary (1.65 BPC) outperforms the 8K vocabulary (1.75 BPC), following the expected pattern for subword tokenizers where larger vocabularies reduce segmentation granularity.

### 6.4 Training Dynamics

| Metric                       | CST-8K       | SPM-8K       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Epoch 1 BPC                  | 1.17         | 1.91         |
| Epoch 2 BPC                  | 1.14         | 1.78         |
| Epoch 3 BPC                  | 1.13         | 1.75         |
| Epoch-over-epoch improvement | -0.02, -0.01 | -0.13, -0.03 |

CST converges faster and starts from a lower initial loss. At epoch 1, CST-8K already achieves 1.17 BPC, a level that SPM-8K does not reach even after 3 epochs. SPM-8K shows larger epoch-over-epoch improvements, suggesting it may continue to narrow the gap with more training, but the initial advantage of structured tokenization is substantial.

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 Why Does Semantic Tokenization Help?

We identify three mechanisms through which CST improves language modeling:

**Sequence compression.** CST represents each content word as a single token (ROOT or CMP), whereas BPE may split it into 2–4 subword fragments. Shorter sequences mean the model's self-attention operates over a more compact representation of the same information, reducing the distance between semantically related tokens.

**Structured inductive bias.** CST tokens explicitly encode semantic fields and morphological roles. The token `CMP:write:agent` signals that this word belongs to the _write_ semantic cluster and functions as an _agent_. The model does not need to learn these relationships from raw co-occurrence statistics — they are provided directly in the input representation. This is the computational realization of the Arabic algebra: the model receives root × pattern as structured input rather than recovering it implicitly from data.

**Field-level generalization.** Words mapped to the same semantic field share a token prefix. "Writer," "writing," "written," and "wrote" all produce tokens beginning with `write`, differing only in role. This enables the model to generalize across morphological variants without needing to see each surface form in training. In Arabic, this generalization is automatic: any word derived from كتب shares root identity in the morphological representation. CST makes the equivalent generalization available to models trained on English.

### 7.2 Arabic as the Natural Next Step

The experiments in this paper are conducted on English. Arabic is, in a precise sense, the language for which CST requires the least additional work and where its advantages are largest.

In Arabic, the CST pipeline's morphological decomposition stage is replaced by a direct root-pattern extraction. Tools such as Farasa (Abdelali et al., 2016) and CAMeL Tools (Obeid et al., 2020) extract Arabic roots and patterns from surface forms with high accuracy. Where the English tokenizer detects the suffix _-er_ in "writer" and looks up "write" in the semantic field dictionary, the Arabic tokenizer reads كاتب, identifies root كتب and pattern فاعل, and emits `CMP:write:agent` directly — the same token.

This means that an Arabic CST tokenizer produces a higher proportion of CMP tokens (lower LIT rate) than the English tokenizer, because Arabic morphological regularity makes more words decomposable. The 66.1% structured token rate achieved on English Wikipedia is a lower bound on what Arabic would achieve.

Furthermore, because the semantic tokens are identical across languages, a model pretrained on English CST tokens and then fine-tuned on Arabic CST tokens shares a common vocabulary for all semantic content. The cross-lingual transfer requires no alignment: `CMP:write:agent` means the same thing whether the training sentence came from English or Arabic.

### 7.3 Cross-Lingual Properties

A key architectural property of CST is that its semantic vocabulary (~846 tokens) is bounded and language-agnostic. The number of universal semantic fields is finite. As corpus size grows, the rate of new LIT tokens decreases sublinearly, since most content words eventually map to existing fields as the dictionary expands.

In contrast, BPE vocabularies scale linearly with linguistic diversity. A multilingual BPE tokenizer must allocate vocabulary slots to language-specific character sequences. CST's semantic fields are language-agnostic: _write_ in English, _écrire_ in French, _كتب_ in Arabic, and _書く_ in Japanese all map to the same field. This has a direct consequence: two languages can share one model if they share the CST semantic token space — which they do by construction. An English sentence and its Arabic translation produce overlapping token sequences:

- English: `[CMP:write:agent] [CMP:send:past] [REL:to] [CMP:know:causer]`
- Arabic: `[CMP:write:agent] [CMP:send:past] [REL:to] [CMP:know:causer]`

The model learns in concept space. Languages are different surfaces over the same semantic structure.

Adding a new language to CST requires: (1) a morphological analyzer for that language, (2) language-specific entries in the relation and structure maps (~30 new entries), and (3) language-specific LIT tokens. The ~846 semantic tokens transfer unchanged. For morphologically rich languages — Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Finnish — where the root-pattern or agglutinative structure is explicit in word form, step (1) is well-supported by existing tools. The semantic algebra that Arabic revealed is the foundation; CST is the generalization.

### 7.4 UNK Rate as Implicit Regularization

The observation that CST-8K outperforms CST-32K is noteworthy. The 5.6% UNK rate at 8K acts as a form of input-level dropout, preventing the model from memorizing rare surface forms and forcing it to rely on the semantic structure of the remaining tokens. This mirrors findings in the dropout literature (Srivastava et al., 2014) where input-level noise can improve generalization by preventing co-adaptation. In CST's case, the "noise" is linguistically principled: only rare, low-frequency surface forms are collapsed to UNK, while the semantic structure remains intact. This suggests that aggressive vocabulary capping may be a useful technique for CST, particularly in low-resource settings where data sparsity makes embedding rare tokens counterproductive.

### 7.5 Limitations

**Semantic field coverage.** Our implementation covers approximately 2,400 lemma-to-field mappings. At 8K vocabulary with capping, 5.6% of token occurrences fall to UNK. Expanding the semantic dictionary would improve coverage, but even at current levels the model achieves strong results.

**Dependency on NLP tooling.** CST relies on compromise.js for lemmatization and NER. The quality of these components directly affects tokenization quality. Errors in lemmatization propagate to incorrect field resolution. Replacing the NLP backend with a more accurate tool would likely improve results.

**Single-language evaluation.** We evaluate on English only. While the semantic field framework is theoretically language-universal, and while the Arabic origin of the framework suggests strong applicability to Semitic languages, empirical validation on morphologically rich languages (Arabic, Turkish, Finnish) and typologically diverse languages (Mandarin, Japanese) is needed.

**Small-scale experiments.** Our experiments use 100K sentences and models up to 13M parameters. It remains an open question whether CST's advantages persist at the scale of modern language models. We observe consistent results across both vocabulary sizes (35.5% at 8K, 25.2% at 32K), suggesting the effect is not vocabulary-size dependent, though validation at larger scale remains future work.

**Downstream task evaluation.** We evaluate on language modeling (BPC) only. Evaluation on downstream tasks such as sentiment classification, question answering, and machine translation would provide a more complete picture of CST's utility.

## 8. Future Work

**Arabic CST.** The conceptual origin of this work is Arabic morphology. Implementing CST for Arabic using Farasa or CAMeL Tools for root-pattern extraction would validate the framework on the language that motivated it and is expected to yield higher structured token coverage than English. An empirical validation — training a single model on interleaved English and Arabic CST tokens — would test whether the shared semantic space enables genuine cross-lingual transfer without parallel data.

**Multilingual CST.** Beyond Arabic, CST is a natural fit for Hebrew (Semitic root system), Turkish (agglutinative morphology with explicit role suffixes), and Finnish (case-marked noun morphology). A multilingual semantic dictionary mapping lemmas from multiple languages to the same field set would enable a shared tokenizer with a compact, language-agnostic vocabulary.

**Downstream task evaluation.** Evaluation on classification (SST-2), question answering (SQuAD), natural language inference (MNLI), and machine translation benchmarks would establish whether BPC improvements translate to task-level gains.

**Scaling experiments.** Training larger models (100M+ parameters) on larger corpora (1M+ sentences) would clarify whether CST's advantages persist or diminish at scale.

**Hybrid tokenization.** Rather than falling back to LIT tokens for unresolved words, a hybrid approach could use subword segmentation as a fallback, combining CST's semantic precision with BPE's robustness for out-of-vocabulary words.

**Learnable semantic fields.** The current field dictionary is manually curated. An automatic method for inducing semantic fields from distributional data — for example, by clustering word embeddings and mapping clusters to field labels — could scale CST to open-vocabulary settings.

## 9. Conclusion

We have presented Contextual Semantic Tokenization, a linguistically-grounded tokenization method whose conceptual foundation is the algebraic structure of Arabic triconsonantal morphology. Arabic root × pattern composition — a system refined over fourteen centuries of linguistic use — encodes semantic field and morphological role directly in word structure. CST generalizes this principle to a universal framework, recovering the same structured information from English through lemmatization and affix detection, and encoding it as typed semantic tokens that any language model can train on.

In controlled experiments with identical model architectures and parameter counts, CST reduces bits-per-character by 35.5% at 8K vocabulary and 25.2% at 32K vocabulary compared to SentencePiece BPE. CST also produces 30% shorter token sequences, yielding faster training.

These results demonstrate that encoding linguistic structure directly into the tokenization layer provides a meaningful inductive bias for language modeling. The approach is simple to implement, requires no additional training beyond dictionary construction, and produces interpretable tokens. Its most natural extension is Arabic — the language whose morphological algebra made the principle visible — and from there to any language with recoverable morphological structure.

The Arabic root-pattern system was a formal algebra long before neural language models existed. CST is, in one sense, the observation that this algebra was always a tokenizer waiting to be used.

**BPE-8K segmentation:** `▁The ▁research ers ▁discover ed ▁that ▁re writ ing ▁the ▁algorithm ▁significant ly ▁improv ed ▁comput ational ▁effic iency` (17 tokens)

**CST:** 12 tokens. **BPE-8K:** 17 tokens. CST captures semantic relationships that BPE fragments lose.

**Cross-lingual example:** The Arabic equivalent — "اكتشف الباحثون أن إعادة كتابة الخوارزمية حسّنت الكفاءة الحسابية بشكل ملحوظ" — produces a largely overlapping CST sequence, because Arabic morphology delivers the root-pattern decomposition directly:

| Token               | Type | Arabic source                                         |
| ------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `STR:past`          | STR  | Sentence-level past tense                             |
| `CMP:know:past`     | CMP  | اكتشف — root ك-ش-ف (know), pattern افتعل (past)       |
| `CMP:science:agent` | CMP  | الباحثون — root ب-ح-ث (science), pattern فاعل (agent) |
| `REL:that`          | REL  | أن                                                    |
| `CMP:write:repeat`  | CMP  | إعادة كتابة — root ك-ت-ب (write), إعادة (repeat)      |
| `ROOT:think`        | ROOT | الخوارزمية — field _think_                            |
| `CMP:fix:past`      | CMP  | حسّنت — root ح-س-ن (fix), pattern فعّل (past)         |
| `CMP:work:state`    | CMP  | الكفاءة — field _work_, role _state_                  |
| `CMP:think:quality` | CMP  | الحسابية — field _think_, role _quality_              |

The semantic tokens are identical. Only language-specific function words differ. This is the cross-lingual property of CST made concrete: Arabic morphology directly produces the same token representation that English requires a processing pipeline to recover.

These fields originate from the Arabic Algebra Engine's root dictionary, which organized 820+ Arabic roots into semantic domains. The fields were subsequently found to be universal — the same semantic domains appear in English, and the same Arabic roots that anchor each domain map to the same English lemma clusters.
